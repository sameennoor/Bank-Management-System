# Bank-Management-System
This Programming Fundamentals project is a C-based Bank Management System designed to automate basic banking tasks. It allows users to perform operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries through a simple console interface.
## Overview
A Programming Fundamentals project developed in C language to digitalize and automate basic banking operations.
The system allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and view account details through a simple console interface.
It uses file handling to save and manage account records, ensuring persistence even after the program ends.
## Background
Before computerized systems, banks relied on manual record keeping and paper-based transactions, which were time-consuming and prone to errors.
This project provides a basic digital solution that simplifies these processes, reduces human error, and makes banking operations more efficient and reliable.
## Objectives
To automate manual banking operations using C programming.

To perform essential tasks such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

To store transaction details securely using text file handling.
## Technologies Used
### Language: 
C language is used.
### Concepts Used: 
Functions, Loops, Conditional Statements, File Handling, and Basic I/O
### Files:
main.c – Contains the program logic.

Account.txt – Stores account and transaction details.
## Features
